# Image Classification Project : This project is about classifying image data sets by building machine learning models and evaluating its performance on testing data set.
The images are related to weather which are captured at different time and locations. Each of this images relates to three categories such as 
  -cloudy 
  -Sunny
  -Rainy

Each of these categorical images are stored in different folders organize

# Objective - build CNN Machine learning model to understand the pattern of images and predict and classify them accordingly.
  
  **- Following tasks have been performed in this python project:**
  - Prepare the data by Loading the image data sets by combining all the three categorical imanges stored in different folders.
  - Explore the data set.
  - resizing of images which are in different size formats.
  - Prepare the data for feeding it to CNN neural network.
  - Build Simple model and analyze its performance.
  - Create transformed images
  - divide the image data by its class
  - Augment the training data
  - Create Simple CNN model and fit the augmented training data and evaluate its performance.
  - Find the optimal model by tuing
  - Train the optimal model until it reachs to the satisfactory results.
  - Evaluate the model performance on test data.
